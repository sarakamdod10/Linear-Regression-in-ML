# ML-Linear Regression Algorithm

Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. ... Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output).

## Usage/Examples

```machine learning
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
exp_sal = pd.read_csv('/content/Salary_Data.csv')

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
train_x,test_x,train_y,test_y = train_test_split(x,y,
                                                 test_size = 0.2,
                                                 random_state = 2021)
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```
